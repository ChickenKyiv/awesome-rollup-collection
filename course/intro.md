Class project introduction

Your project is to create a page with recipe cards. Nothing complex, but you need to use flexboxes. Don't use CSS grids or Bootstrap.

It should have a Header, Footer, Navigation(linked to recipe cards at content).With three or more blocks-cards with details about your favorite dishes.

You can use a plain CSS or SASS.

As a code style and "best practice" example you can use SMACSS https://smacss.com/

BUT you restricted to use BEM approach(it's good if you don't know what I'm talking about).

Be cool with your code, use comments, if you want to create easy to understand code structure.


Data

Check this image samples





If you need actual data for your blocks, you can check it at the plugin, that we've built: https://github.com/GroceriStar/groceristar-fetch/blob/master/data/Recipe4/recipe-short-version.json

the main structure of the recipe is(but not limited too)

```
recipe

 - header

   -- title

   -- image

 - description

     -- data

 - ingredients list

   -- data

 - directions list

   -- data
```




You can start to work on your project before finishing the whole course.
I propose you to create a plan, split things into small chunks and move forward by closing this small tasks.





I'll be happy if you do not just complete this project, but go forward and make it better. So take time, generate ideas and experiment. If you want to learn how to code == you should code as much as possible. You can polish this project, while you'll like the code quality.


Please don't worry, if something wouldn't be easy to understand at the first time. Share your process with other students in our Project Directory.  It's much easy to solve problems together!





Additional Assesment(For A+)

1) Each recipe in our example has one image. You can create an image gallery.

2)  You can add easing animations, so scrolling(after clicking on top menu) will have cool animation.
