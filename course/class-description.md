This course will teach you basics, related to creating an independent JS module. If you created a nodejs porject before, you know, that there a lot of separated modules already exsiting at npmjs.org that you can install and use.

It's a package registry for JS modules. And we will create another one module. We woudln't touch big topics like:
"How to promote your OSS project"
"How to build a community"
"How to create a cool readme and Contribution guide"
you can explore that topics on your own , if you want t people to use your code.

Our goal is to create a simple module, setup an advanced configuration in the end that will support complex cases and show you a different options of config.

Babel, as our transpiler module, will help us to transpile our code from ES6 version to ES5, which is major version that using by community, but lacking a features that was introduced at es6 specification.

Latest major release of Babel is 7. And I didn't find many tutorials, that touching a topic of configuration of Babel 7. So we will do it here.


1) basic setup.
2) install first packages at dev section
2) babel setup + plugins + configuration

3) setup & publish
4) Why to use rollup if we have babel
5) shx -> what it's about
6) Jest tests + install+ configuration+connect with babel
7) rollup config + connect to babel
8) if you create a React Component at your module, you'll also need to install an Enzyme + Adapter
9) basic Travis CI configuration
10) Coveralls/CodeClimate install/save
11) Why do we need an advanced setup?
12) Add ESLint
13) Prepare code/ configuration scripts to build and publish at npm


You need to know JS basics, Nodejs setup basics. How to install modules from npm and include them to your project using npm or yarn.

Example:
This class is about learning how flexboxes work.
Did you hear about them before?

It's a module, that has roots at Mozilla. It's a big timesaver for Frontend developers.
You'll never want to create an HTML page without flexboxes after this course.

We'll learn only basic things. Specification mostly.

All CSS properties related to flexboxes.
And we'll have a set of easy practical lessons.
For each practice lesson, I advise you to recreate an example from scratch(no copy-paste) by your hands.


Be aware, that this course touching only flexbox basics, so you need to know HTML and CSS.

TOOLKIT


Github(https://github.com/) - if you ok to share your code with other - My current pick
Bitbucket(https://bitbucket.org/) - if you want to have a free storage


Google drive(https://www.google.com/drive/)  or Dropbox(https://www.dropbox.com/?landing=dbv2) - if you just want to save your code at cloud


You can also use Codesandbox(https://codesandbox.io) or other online editors.
For practice lessons, I'll use CodePen(http://codepen.io).

But I'm sure - for your project, you'll decide to use a code editor.


Code editors
Sublime(https://www.sublimetext.com/3) - I use it around 6 years. small size and everything important
Atom(https://atom.io/) because it's backed by the GitHub team and it also has a Github sync.


If you want to save your project tasks, you can use Trello(https://trello.com)
