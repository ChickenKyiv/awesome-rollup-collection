Why use Git as a developer
This tool is inescapable for worldwide developers. Here is a list of advantages of this tool:

No more copies, when you finish your work on a significant update for your application or a bug fix, you just need to “push” your project online to save it.

Delete and break your code; you just need to type a command to come back to the previous version and continue your work.
Work with your friends without sending an e-mail with the compressed project each time the code changes.

You can afford to forget what you did. A simple command is necessary to check your changes since the last time you saved your work.

I just told you the main advantages if you don’t use Git at the moment. Believe me; this tool can become paramount. As an example, you can configure services to work with Git and automatically deploy and test your code.
