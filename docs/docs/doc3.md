Where to find Git repositories
If you want to start using Git, you need to know where to host your repositories. There are many hosting platforms where you can put your code free of charge. Some options aren’t free, but mostly you don’t need them except in specific cases.

Here the three most popular Git hosting services:

- *GitHub*: Owned recently by Microsoft — Launched in 2008 (37 million users in May 2019 and 100 million open repositories).

- *GitLab*: Owned by GitLab Inc. — Launched in 2011.

- *BitBucket*: Owned by Atlassian — Launched in June 2008.

> Note: Hosting platforms are available in two ways, on the cloud (hosted online) or self-installed on your server (private hosting).
